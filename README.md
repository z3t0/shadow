### What is this repository for? ###
**Project Name: SumoDuino**

**Project Summary: Arduino based project (clone) using custom PCB design to make a SumoBot Board capable of seeking and pushing enemy bot while staying within the ring.**

**Version: 1.1**

### Features ###
* Seek and find navigation system
* Line-Sensing logic to keep robot in the ring
* Dual Ultrasonic sensors to prevent against interference and to allow accurate seeking
* Custom PCB design

### How do I get set up? ###

* The sketch file simply needs to be copied into a folder of the same name to be used with the [Official Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
* The only dependencies outside of the Arduino core libraries is the [NewPing](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPing) Library that is used for the ultrasonic sensors.
* Arduino IDE can be used to deploy code to the device.
